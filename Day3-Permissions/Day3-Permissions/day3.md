# ðŸ“˜ Day 3 â€“ Linux Basics: File Permissions & Ownership

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Understand how Linux file permissions work and practice changing them using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.

---

## ðŸ–¥ Commands Practiced

1. **`ls -l`** â€“ View file permissions

   ```bash
   ls -l file1.txt
   ```

   âœ… Shows permissions, owner, group, file size, and timestamp.

---

2. **`chmod`** â€“ Change file permissions

   * Grant read, write, and execute using numeric values:

     ```bash
     chmod 744 file1.txt
     ```

     âœ… Permissions: Owner = read/write/execute, Group = read, Others = read.

   * Add execute permission:

     ```bash
     chmod +x script.sh
     ```

---

3. **`chown`** â€“ Change file ownership

   ```bash
   sudo chown user:group file1.txt
   ```

---

4. **`chgrp`** â€“ Change group ownership

   ```bash
   sudo chgrp developers file1.txt
   ```

---

## ðŸ“‚ Practice Example

```bash
mkdir Day3-Permissions
cd Day3-Permissions

# Create a file
touch file1.txt
ls -l file1.txt

# Change permissions
chmod 744 file1.txt
ls -l file1.txt

# Create and run a script
echo "echo Hello Linux" > script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

**Output:**

```
Hello Linux
```
